## React BMI Calculator

### A class-based React app to calculate the body mass index of a person 

The user can add the height & weight by either using the slider or simply adding the numbers manually. The calculation will determine the BMI and classify the outcome as "underweight", "normal", "overweight", or "obese" with corresponding bonus cat pictures. 

**Range slider component source:** https://whoisandy.github.io/react-rangeslider/
